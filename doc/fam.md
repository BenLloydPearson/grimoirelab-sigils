# Frequently Asked Metrics (FAM)

Welcome to our FAM! The goal of this document is to show you
how to retrieve the usual metrics asked by community managers
and other roles in open and inner source projects.

If you feel your specific metric should be available, please
feel free to add your own pull request or open a bug report
in this project.

The following is a list of the current FAMs available in this
document:

* [How can I retrieve the attraction of new developers to my community?](#attraction-of-newcomers)
* [How can I measure my lag solving issues?](#lag-solving-issues)
* [How can I have a list of the most active developers?](#the-most-active-developers)
* [How can I have a list of the most active organizations?](#the-most-active-organizations)
* [How can I have a list of the most active repositories?](#the-most-active-repositories)

## Attraction of newcomers

This information is found in the 'Demographics' panel of the dashboard.

This image is calculated as aggregation of the developers doing their
first commit in a period of time.

In the image displayed above as an example, there are three main
areas of interest for this analysis. Those three areas are the
three peaks of attraction of developers.

We can see as example that those take place at the beginning of
2016, fall 2016 and early 2017.

What happened in this community during those months to have such
peaks of activity? There are usually different reasons for this,
although this goes from summits to programms such as the Google
Summer of Code or Outreachy activities.

## The most active repositories

[This approach works for almost any panel and for any time selection.
There is a specific section for the last 7 days as this seems to be
a useful timeframe to have a look at. Others such as months or quarters
can be selected in the same way.]

The summary of the activity and community of a project is provided by the Overview panel.
This panel is usually the entry panel for any dashboard.

There are several ways of accessing the information for the last seven days, but this can
be reach by updating the timefilter at the top right corner of the dashboard. Once a new
timeframe of activity is selected, all of the widgets in the panel will be upated.
