# Frequently Asked Metrics (FAM)

Welcome to our FAM! The goal of this document is to show you
how to retrieve the usual metrics asked by community managers
and other roles in open and inner source projects.

If you feel your specific metric should be available, please
feel free to add your own pull request or open a bug report
in this project.

The following is a list of the current FAMs available in this
document:

* [How can I retrieve the attraction of new developers to my community?](#attraction-of-newcomers)
* [How can I measure my lag solving issues?](#lag-solving-issues)
* [How can I have a list of the most active developers?](#the-most-active-developers)
* [How can I have a list of the most active organizations?](#the-most-active-organizations)
* [How can I have a list of the most active repositories?](#the-most-active-repositories)

## Attraction of newcomers

This information is found in the 'Demographics' panel of the dashboard.

![Demographics panel - Attracted developers](assets/images/attracted-developers.jpg)

This image is calculated as aggregation of the developers doing their
first commit in a period of time.

In the image displayed above as an example, there are three main
areas of interest for this analysis. Those three areas are the
three peaks of attraction of developers.

We can see as example that those take place at the beginning of
2016, fall 2016 and early 2017.

What happened in this community during those months to have such
peaks of activity? There are usually different reasons for this, 
although this goes from summits to programms such as the Google
Summer of Code or Outreachy activities.
